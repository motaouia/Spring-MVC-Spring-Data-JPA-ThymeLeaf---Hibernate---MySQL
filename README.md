A Java web application that manages information in a database – with standard CRUD operations: Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete. We use the following technologies:

*Spring Boot: enables rapid application development with sensible defaults to reduce boilerplate code. Spring Boot also helps us create a standalone, executable Java web application with ease.

*Spring MVC: simplifies coding the controller layer. No more boilerplate code of Java Servlet classes.
Spring Data JPA: simplifies coding the data access layer. No more boilerplate code of DAO classes.

*Hibernate: is used as an ORM framework – implementation of JPA. No more boilerplate JDBC code.

*ThymeLeaf: simplifies coding the view layer. No more cluttered JSP and JSTL tags.
And MySQL as the database.


For project development, we use Eclipse IDE 2018-12, JDK 8, and Maven.
